# Elections data

This folder contains results for the SCTC elections:

* PDF files for each ward with results - [from the SCTC website's election results page](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/the-council/election-results-2018/)
* XLSX files with the same data, converted from PDF
* A CSV combining those files, with names and results cleaned using Open Refine, and an extra surname column created
* An XLSX file with both that data and a pivot table showing votes by party and ward
* A CSV file showing for each ward how many councillors were elected and whether the ward voted for Conservative or a mix of Labour and Conservative councillors
