## Methodology

We primarily used information published on the town council's [Budget/Finance page](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/how-we-spend-your-money/budgetfinance/)

The [Statement of Accounts 2016-17](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Statement-of-Accounts-2016-17.pdf) provides overall figures for money budgeted and spent in that year. The [Statement of Accounts 2017-18](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sutton-Coldfield-2018-Accounts-1.pdf) - not yet published on the Budget/Finance page - covers the last year.

These were used to create the charts on overall spend and spend vs budget by category.

The [internal audit report](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Internal-Audit-Final-Report-2016-17.pdf) provided further context, such as that the council had not invested any of its reserved of over £1m.

Context for some contracts was taken from the [contracts 2016-17 breakdown](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Contracts-2016-17.pdf), which identifies the supplier and period covered. 

Agenda items for council meetings could also provide extra detail, [such as this one on the Summer in Sutton CBSO concert](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ANRqQMQCoQaKwoc&cid=663CAED515AB37FE&id=663CAED515AB37FE%2161765&parId=663CAED515AB37FE%2161764&o=OneUp) where it was proposed to spend the entire budget on one event.

Community Grant data is harder to pin down. Overall spending is in the budget, but to get a breakdown by ward we needed to use a number of sources:

* Grant applications are [listed in PDF documents for each meeting](https://suttoncoldfieldlocal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Copy-of-Community-Grant-Fund-Amenities-15-November..pdf) with the ward identified - these do not say whether the applications were approved, but expenditure data does say whether those organisations received money under the Community Grant category. Older meeting documents do not provide this detail, however.
* More recent committee meeting documents also include a breakdown of spending to date and budget by ward, such as [this one from January 17 2018](https://royalsuttonnews.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Summary-Table-Jan-2018.pdf). 
* The minutes for each meeting detail which applications were approved or rejected: [here are the minutes for the same January 17 2018 meeting](https://royalsuttonnews.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/draft-minutes-v1-2.pdf). In some cases applications for the Community Grant fund are referred to other budgets. [Here are minutes from a meeting a year earlier](https://suttoncoldfieldlocal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/145-b-Minutes-17th-Jan-2017.pdf) and [one for March 2017](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/11077-Minutes_Draft_New.pdf)and [one for July 2017](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/15183-draft_minutes_vol_2.pdf). Sometimes there are additional documents for specific agenda items, [such as this on the Changing Places toilet proposal in January 2018](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Changing-Places-Toilet-Facility-v1links.pdf)
* We used the [documents for March 13 2018 which show the last breakdown of the financial year](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Summary-Table-March-2018.pdf) and then added grant awards made in the minutes [for the same meeting in March 2018](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Item-153b-ALC-Min.pdf) when the final grant approvals of the financial year were made, to reach a total.
* [Community Grants Awarded in 2016/17](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Community-Grants-Payments-2016-17.pdf) lists which ones were approved, but does *not* say which ward and budget they related to.
* The council website's [Community Grant Scheme page](https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/apply-for-a-grant/community-grant-scheme/) lists the funding allocated for the last year, but again without ward details.
* Postcodes can be tied to wards by using [Doogal's postcode lookup service](https://www.doogal.co.uk/UKPostcodes.php): [this is the lookup for B72 1RN](https://www.doogal.co.uk/ShowMap.php?postcode=B72%201RN)
